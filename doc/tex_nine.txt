    TeX 9 is a filetype plugin that enhances significantly the writing
    experience of high quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The scope of TeX
    9 is to rely first and foremost on features that are already available in
    Vim and try to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. Indeed, TeX
    9's codebase is only about 600 SLOC. 
    
    Most of TeX 9 is implemented in Python (2.6, 2.7) and therefore a Vim
    installation with Python support is required (see|feature-list|).  In
    addition, TeX 9 depends on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher.
    Matchit is shipped with the standard installation of Vim but it is also
    bundled with TeX 9 for convenience. See |matchit-install| for further
    information.

    TeX 9's main features are
        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim.
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease.
        * Select-objects for in-line maths and math environments.
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references.
        * SyncTeX support for Evince 2.32 (requires python-dbus).
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler).
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski).
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings.

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher
        * Johannes Tanzler, Jose Aliste, Sergio Losilla

    TODOs
        * Windows support: adding the necessary hooks for Windows support
          should quite trivial thanks to Python, but I do not have an access
          to such a computer. Help is welcome.

==============================================================================

1.  Installation                                    *tex_nine-installation*

    TeX 9 is distributed as a gzipped tarball. Unzip it to your local runtime
    path, usually `~/.vim/'. The scripts are located in the `ftplugin/TeX_9'
    directory and all TeX 9 files mentioned in this help file are relative to
    that. 

    Note! In your vimrc, it's mandatory to set `g:tex_flavor' to the compiler
    you wish to use or otherwise TeX 9 is not loaded at all. Other settings
    you may want to tweak are:

    g:tex_viewer  
        * Vim dictionary with entries 'app' and 'target'.
        * Default: {'app': 'xdg-open', 'target': 'pdf'}

    g:tex_bibfiles
        * Vim list that enumerates the BibTeX databases you want to use
        * You need only to specify the name of your database if the file 
          resides under a valid texmf tree, i.e. under
          `$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/', or in the compilation folder.
          Alternatively, you may specify the whole path.
        * Default: Disabled

    g:tex_verbose
        * Boolean
        * If set to 1, TeX 9 doesn't attempt to filter irrelevant
          warning messages that LaTeX compilers produce. Error messages
          are gathered in a ||quickfix|| list that you may access by
          typing <LocalLeader>Q in normal mode.
        * Default: Error messages are filtered.

    g:tex_synctex
        * Boolean
        * Evince 2.32 only
        * If set to 1, you can highlight lines in the PDF you're writing based
          on where you are in Vim. See more detailed instructions below.
        * Default: Disabled

    Example vimrc for old school latex users: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'latex'
        let g:tex_viewer = {'app': 'xdvi', 'target': 'dvi'}
<
    Another one for a XeLaTeX user that has multiple BibTeX databases: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'xelatex'
        let g:tex_bibfiles = ['main.bib', '~/thesis/ad_hoc.bib']
<
    Before you start typesetting documents, you may want to customize the
    document template file `tex_skeleton.tex' in the `skeleton' directory.
    You can safely erase the header with dynamical content if you don't
    want it.

    Finally, should you want to disable TeX 9 temporarily, put this in
    your vimrc: >

        au BufReadPre *.tex let b:init_tex_nine = 1
<

==============================================================================

2.  Basics                                          *tex_nine-basics*

    In an empty LaTeX manuscript, press <F1> to insert a skeleton of a
    document. Almost all other TeX 9 mappings are prefixed with
    |maplocalleader| that defaults to semi-colon, `;'. Typing `;a' would
    result in `\alpha' for instance. See |tex_nine-mappings| below for a
    complete listing. To insert the actual character that <LocalLeader> was
    set to, type <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>.

    The following mappings work in insert mode. Use <LocalLeader>C to
    insert a citation, i.e. `\cite{citekey}'. You're prompted with
    a popup list of citekeys if you set `g:tex_bibfiles'. You can
    keep on inserting citations inside the curly braces as long as
    you separate them with commas. References, `\ref{ref}', work in
    a similar way: the corresponding mapping is <LocalLeader>R. Label
    search is performed only in the current buffer.

    To insert an environment, press <LocalLeader>B. You're prompted for an
    environment name and if a corresponding LaTeX code snippet was defined, it
    is inserted into the manuscript. Finally, should you forget the name of a
    standard LaTeX command, type <LocalLeader>K for dictionary completion, or
    should you need advice on LaTeX, consult the LaTeX2e manual with `:help
    latex'.

    You may compile the document in normal mode. <LocalLeader>k, `small
    compile', compiles your document once and doesn't bother about references;
    <LocalLeader>K, `big compile', calls additionally bibtex and should get
    the cross-references right. You're informed about potential errors: to go
    over them open the ||quickfix|| list with <LocalLeader>Q. Typing
    <LocalLeader>V should open the document in your system's default PDF
    viewer, if you didn't set `g:tex_viewer' to something else. 

==============================================================================

3.  Snippets                                        *tex_nine-snippets*

    When you want to insert a LaTeX snippet with <LocalLeader>B, notice that
    the input prompt is <Tab>-completable. Your input is matched against words
    in `dictionaries/tex_dictionary.txt'. Once entered, the name of the
    environment is matched against keywords in the file
    `snippets/tex_snippets.snippets'. Matching snippets are inserted.
    Otherwise TeX 9 inserts a generic environment in LaTeX manuscripts and
    raises an error in BibTeX files.
    >
        % Generic environment
        \begin{keyword}

        \end{keyword}
<
    You may extend the snippet file with your own environments and you will
    notice that the syntax bears resemblance with Michael Sander's snipMate
    plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540). TeX 9
    leaves the <Tab> key untouched so that you may still resort to snipMate if
    you so prefer. If your custom environments is not included in
    `tex_dictionary.txt', append it there. >
            
        :cd ~/.vim/ftplugin/TeX_9/dictionaries
        :!echo 'new_environment' >> tex_dictionary.txt
<
==============================================================================

4.  BibTeX                                          *tex_nine-bibtex*

    When you want to revise a particular entry in your database, you may
    easily jump to it by pressing `gb' over its citekey, i.e.
    `\cite{citekey}'. This command is in line with ||gd|| and ||gf|| with the
    exception that an additional preview window is opened so that you can jump
    back to the original manuscript.

    When you want to extend or update your databases, press <LocalLeader>U in
    normal mode either while in the database or the manuscript. If you
    want to include a new database, redefine `g:tex_bibfiles' and press
    <LocalLeader>U again. 
    >
        :let g:tex_bibfiles += ['ad_hoc.bib']
<
    Remember to redefine the `\bibliography' command
    accordingly. TeX 9 doesn't bother to check it at all to avoid problems
    when viewing others' LaTeX manuscripts.

    Finally, <C-F> and <C-B> are remapped to jump between database entries in
    BibTeX files.

==============================================================================

5.  SyncTeX                                         *tex_nine-synctex*

    At this stage SyncTeX support is only targeted at Gnome 2.32 users that
    use Evince 2.32 (Ubuntu 11.04 etc.). If you enabled `g:tex_synctex', you
    may look up how the line or equation you're typesetting looks in the PDF
    and vice versa.  Forward search (LaTeX manuscript -> PDF) is performed by
    typing VS, "Visual Syncronize", in normal mode. Backward search (PDF ->
    LaTeX manuscript) is performed by Ctrl-clicking a line in the PDF you're
    viewing with Evince. Naturally, this only works if you're searching a
    up-to-date version of your manuscript.

    SyncTeX support should be considered experimental. Evince uses DBUS to
    communicate with TeX 9 and therefore you need to have `python-dbus'
    installed on your computer. The DBUS API has changed in Gnome 3 and so
    this feature isn't available for Gnome 3 users. In addition, current
    implementation does not support URI's with whitespaces or non-ASCII
    characters.

==============================================================================

6.  Mappings                                        *tex_nine-mappings*

    <LocalLeader> is semi-colon by default. Change the value of
    'maplocalleader' in `ftplugin/tex_nine.vim' to suit your taste.

6.4 Extras

    The usual inner paragraph, 'ip', text object is revamped to handle
    equations. Press 'vip' anywhere inside a maths environment to
    highlight its contents. The outer paragraph alternative, 'ap' includes
    the delimiting lines that contain `\\(begin|end)'. In addition, you
    may easily operate on in-line maths, e.g.  `$E=mc^{2}$', with the the
    text objects `i$' and `a$', inner and outer equation.
    
    TeX 9 completes dollar signs, parens, brackets and curly braces. In
    similar vein, type '^^' to insert '^{}', '__' to insert '_{}', '~~' to
    insert '\approx' and '==' to insert aligned equation sign '&='. 

    Try omni-completion () inside curly braces when you're including a
    picture with `\includegraphics{}' or when you're setting your font with
    the `fontspec' package, i.e. `\setmainfont{}'. You'll get a listing of
    pictures in the compilation folder in the first case and a list of
    installed font on your system in the latter. Supported picture formats are
    EPS, PDF, JPG and PNG.

7.  Tips and trick                                  *tex_nine-tips*

7.1     Extending TeX 9: Custom template files

        You can create your own macros/mappings and enable them by placing
        them in a file that is located in the ftplugin directory and whose
        filename is prefixed with `tex', e.g. `~/.vim/ftplugin/tex_foobar.vim'. 

        You may, for example, create more template files for different
        documentclasses and insert them in your manuscripts with a mapping.

        Define the path to your custom template file in the file of your
        choice. >

                let b:mytemp = 'path/to/it/skeleton.tex'
<
        and map <F2> for instance to do the insertion in normal mode. >
                
                noremap <buffer> <F2> :call tex_nine#InsertTemplate(b:mytemp)<CR>

7.2     Extending TeX 9: Shortcuts for snippets

        Similarly, you may want to create shortcuts for snippet insertion if
        you don't want to use <LocalLeader>B all the time.

        An example for mapping <F1> to insert an equation snippet: >
                
                inoremap <buffer><expr> <F1> tex_nine#InsertEnvironment('equation')
<
        If you come up with something sweet, please drop me a line (email
        address behind a reCAPTCHA in the README file.).

7.3     Spell checking

        If you've enabled 'modeline', you may conveniently activate spell
        checking in your LaTeX manuscripts by editing the modeline in the
        template file.

        Example for anglophones: >

                % vim:tw=66 sw=2 ft=tex spell spelllang=en
<
        Notice that newer versions of Vim provide an option >

                let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1

<       for disabling spell checking of comments that otherwise get messed up
        pretty badly.

7.4     Remove temporary TeX files
    
        To delete the temporary files that LaTeX compilers produce, use
        shell/Vim expansions like so: >

                !rm %<.{aux,bbl,toc,log}
<
7.5     Folding

        With newer versions of Vim it's easy as >

                let g:tex_fold_enabled = 1
